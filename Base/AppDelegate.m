/* Upon user sign up, the app will ask if the user wants to create or join a base. Depending on what TYPE of base the user creates/joins,
 * the app will load the interface for that type. 
 *
 *     (e.g. EMS Base will have options for responding to calls, where a standard group Base will instead have options to create/join 
 *      events)
